#### How to run locally
   If you want to clone our repository and run our project locally, then you can do this by opening the terminal 
   and write:
   
   `git clone https://github.com/IT2810/it2810-webutvikling-h17-prosjekt-4-group-50.git`
   
   Install the angular CLI for your terminal in order to be able to build our project with the following command:
   
 Â  `npm install @angular/{common,compiler,compiler-cli,core,forms,http,platform-browser,platform-browser-dynamic,platform-server,router,animations}@latest typescript@latest --save`
   
   Now that you have our project locally navigate to the \website folder and install the dependencies with 
   
   `npm install`
   
   Everything is now set up and you can start our server with the following
   
   `npm start`
   
   Then open a new tab of the terminal and run
   
   `ng build --watch`
   
   Our website will now be built locally and are hosted on localhost:8084
