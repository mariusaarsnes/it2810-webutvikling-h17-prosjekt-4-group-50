Our `testing` branch has not yet been merged into `dev`. This is mostly because all the tests are not working as of now, 
since pulling from dev created new problems. 

Most of the work that has been done with testing has been to make the standard generated tests to work. 
This has been done by importing different provders etc. and making mock-data and -services.

In general we would like any type of feedback that can help us with the testing. If you have any tips on how to make tests with Material UI work, mainly how to make attributes bind to different tags, 
it would be greatly appreciated if you shared them with us.

Also, we have not started on writng tests for our backend. 
We will mainly focus on testing our REST-API, since that is basically the only backend functionality we have. 
If you have any valuable input on how to do this it would be greatly appreciated.
