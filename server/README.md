# Project 4 server

##How to run

1. Install the dependencies. This can be done with `npm install`
2. Install the dependencies in the website folder. Then run the command `ng build`. This builds the angular app that
our express is serving. 
3. Run the command `npm start`

Once this is done the server should be serving both the API and the angular app. The API can be accessed from the 
/api directory.
